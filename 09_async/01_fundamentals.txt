++++++++++++++++++ JAVASCRIPT ASYNC FUNDAMENTAKS ++++++++++++++++++

** Default Javascript is Synchronous => first one code will execute , then the second.
   It is single threaded language.

** Execution Context:-
-> execute one line of code at a time.

!-> console log 1
!-> console log 2
!
! CALL STACK         MEMORY HEAP
!

Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

** Blocking Code vs NOn-Blocking Code

-> Blocking Code -> blocks the flow of program -> Read file sync
-> NOn-Blocking -> Code does not block execution -> Read file async
