# JS and Classes

javascript has classes but classes are just syntactic sugar
behind the hood there is only prototype based inherited mechanism
js is prototype based language

## OOPS

## Object
- collection of properties(variables and constant) and methods(functions) 
- toLowerCase

## why use OOPS
- because code was messed up

## parts of oops
Object literal -> actually taking an object

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes                  
- Instances (new, this)

# 4 pillars

- Abstraction 
- Encapsulation 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism
